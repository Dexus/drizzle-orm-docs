# Drizzle \<\> PlanetScale

According to the **[official website](https://planetscale.com/)**, 
PlanetScale is the world's most advanced serverless MySQL platform.

With Drizzle ORM you can access PlanetScale over http
through their official **[`database-js`](https://github.com/planetscale/database-js)**
driver from serverless and serverfull environments with our `drizzle-orm/planetscale-serverless` package.

You can also access PlanetScale through TCP with `mysql2` driver — **[see here.](/docs/get-started-mysql#mysql-2)**

<Npm>
drizzle-orm @planetscale/database
-D drizzle-kit
</Npm>

```typescript copy filename="index.ts"
import { drizzle } from "drizzle-orm/planetscale-serverless";
import { Client } from "@planetscale/database";

const client = new Client({
  host: process.env["DATABASE_HOST"],
  username: process.env["DATABASE_USERNAME"],
  password: process.env["DATABASE_PASSWORD"],
});

const db = drizzle(client);
```

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
Previously, we were suggesting the use of the `connect()` function from the `database-js` driver. However, after receiving a suggestion from the PlanetScale Team and the authors of database-js, we are now enforcing the use of the `Client` instance to handle connections to PlanetScale.

Please note that you will receive a warning to switch from `connect()` to `new Client()`, and starting from version `0.30.0`, you will encounter an error and be required to use the `Client` connection. Make sure to migrate from `connect()` to `Client`

Make sure to checkout the PlanetScale official **[MySQL courses](https://planetscale.com/courses/mysql-for-developers/introduction/course-introduction)**, 
we think they're outstanding 🙌
