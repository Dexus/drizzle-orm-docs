#### Basic file structure {props.lib}

This is the basic file structure of the project. In the `src/db` directory, we have database-related files including connection in `index.ts` and table definition in `schema.ts`. In `drizzle` folder there are sql migration file and snapshots.

```plaintext
ğŸ“¦ <project root>
 â”œ ğŸ“‚ drizzle
 â”œ ğŸ“‚ src
 â”‚   â”œ ğŸ“‚ db
 â”‚   â”‚  â”” ğŸ“œ schema.ts
 â”‚   â”” ğŸ“œ index.ts
 â”œ ğŸ“œ .env
 â”œ ğŸ“œ drizzle.config.ts
 â”œ ğŸ“œ package.json

```
